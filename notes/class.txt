Classes- same like structures but class can have function as members.

Access Specifier
private members of a class are accessible only from within other members of the same class (or from their "friends").
protected members are accessible from other members of the same class (or from their "friends"), but also from members of their derived classes.
Finally, public members are accessible from anywhere where the object is visible.

Constructor - 
function with same name as class_name with no return type, it is only used to initialize the class
data members

we can also overload constructors(same as function overload) change in parameters

when we define a constructor with no parameters it is also known as default constructor since it will be initialized when no values/parameters are given.

'this' pointer(keyword) - it is a pointer that points to the object whose member function is being executed.
it is used within the class member function to refer to the object itself


Static data members ,
same as static variables , it is like a non member variable but have class scope,for that we cant initialize them 
in the class (code example in class.cpp)

Const keyword use in object creation-
const class_name object;

this allows the object (data members) read only that is we cant modify any data members.
