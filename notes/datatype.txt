Fundamental and Compound datatypes

Fundamental are basic datatypes that are inbuilt
we have character , integer , float , boolean

for Compound datatypes we have to include the header file <string> for using and declaring string objects and functions
Compound we have string

Types of datatypes - 
--primitive/built-in
--derived
--user defined

1. Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly 
by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc.

2. Derived Data Types: Derived data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in 
datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely: 
Function
Array
Pointer

3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: Abstract or User-Defined data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:  

Class
Structure
Union
Enumeration
Typedef defined Datatype
