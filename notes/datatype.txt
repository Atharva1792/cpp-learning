Fundamental and Compound datatypes

Fundamental are basic datatypes that are inbuilt
we have character , integer , float , boolean

for Compound datatypes we have to include the header file <string> for using and declaring string objects and functions
Compound we have string

Types of datatypes - 
--primitive/built-in
--derived
--user defined

1. Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly 
by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc.

2. Derived Data Types: Derived data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in 
datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely: 
Function
Array
Pointer

3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: Abstract or User-Defined data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:  

Class
Structure
Union
Enumeration
Typedef defined Datatype

Union - all data members share the same memory location.
That is when one data members value is changed then the change will be done to all the data members 
present in that union's definition.

Enumeration - used to assign name to integral constants.

Typedef - explicitly define new datatype with the type present in the standard C++.

syntax - typedef datatype name;
