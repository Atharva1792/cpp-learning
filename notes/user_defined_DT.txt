structure - can defined various data members with different datatype and use by creating object
union - same as structure but functionality different
        all the data members are stored at same physical location
        size of union is the size of the largest datatype present in its members
        modifying one value of the member will result in change in the value of all data members since they share same physical memory.
Enumeration - same declaration,
              we can assign values to variable names, i.e no type is declared,
              only names have some values
              by default,if values not assigned it takes from (0,1,2...)
              or if assign to any one name then it will add one to next ones

    example - 
            enum months{
                Jan=1,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,June,July,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec
            }mnt;

            we can get values like using Jan(other variables); anywhere in the program
