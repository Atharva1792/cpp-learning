friends are functions or classes , keyword - friend
Non-member functions can access private and protected members of a class if it is declared as a friend of that class.
preceding with 'friend' to any function or class

friend needs to be defined in class declaration and the function we declare a friend of the class is not
a member of that class, it only allows access to private and protected member without being a member.

similarly we have friend class also which is a friend of some class and it allows to access the data members of the class.

class Rectangle{
    ...
};
class Square{
    friend class Rectangle;
    ...
}
