Assignment operator - (=)

Arithmetic - 
+,-,*,/,%(modulo-gives remainder of the division of 2 values)

Compound - 
a+=b ---> a = a +b
-= , *= , /= , %= , >>= , <<= , &= , ^= , |=

increment decrement - (add subtract by 1 )
++ , --
it can be used as prefix(pre-increment:x++) or suffix(post-increment:++x)
using as prefix - the value is increased first and then expression is evaluated
using as postfix - the value is increased later that is the expression is evaluated first and then the value is updated


Relational and Comparison -
== Equal to,
!= not Equal to
< less than
> greater than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to 
these all are used to compare between 2 values

logical-
! NOT  (inverts the output, if output is true then using ! will print false)
&& AND (like truth table values,true true->true,true false->false)
|| OR   (like truth table values,only one true -> true )

Conditional Ternary operator - (?)
condition ? result1:result2
can be used instead of if else

bitwise operator
& bitwise and
| bitwise inclusive or
^ bitwise exclusive xor
~ NOT (Unary complement)
<< shift bits left
>> shift bits right

sizeof() - returns the space it(variable or datatype) takes that is in bytes
