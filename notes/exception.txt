Exceptions provide a way to react to exceptional circumstances (like runtime errors) 
in programs by transferring control to special functions called handlers.

An exception is thrown by using 'throw' keyword inside try block
try block is the code that we want to try and 
only when a exception is thrown it goes to catch block(handler)

handler-
catch block is the one that catches the exception that is we can have certain message/error 
and catch block will allow us to compile the program and we will know that error has occurred.

catch (parameter){}
this parameter's type is important since the exception can be handled only if the type matches
we can have multiple handlers also(catch blocks)
containing different types of parameters
catch(...) - it represents to catch any type of exception occurred
             it can be used as default handler
             ...(ellipsis)

STANDARD EXCEPTION -
C++ has standard library for exception (header file - <exception>)
it has class exception specifically designed for throwing objects for exceptions.
It has a special virtual member - 'what()',which can be redefined by inheriting the exception class
that returns a char* return type.
