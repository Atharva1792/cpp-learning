Abstraction in C++ is the process to hide the internal details and showing functionality only. 
i.e representing only the essential details in the program.

Abstraction can be achieved by two ways:
Abstract class
Interface

Abstract class and interface both can have abstract methods which are necessary for abstraction.

abstract class can be defined by defining atleast one pure virtual function.

It can be achieved in two ways :
using classes - using access specifier we can define which data members and functions to show or give access .
using header file - we dont how the standard library functions are implemented,we only use the functions of it,
hence we can say that the header files hides all the implementation details from user.
