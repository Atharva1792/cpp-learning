Namespace - 
scope where we can define data members that can be accessed anywhere in the program
using the scope operator(::).
This is done to avoid name collisions

namespace name{
    int a;
    int b;
}

we can access it anywhere in the code by: 
name::a; name::b;

Using keyword- 
using includes the name in the present block of code 
using name::a;
then we dont need to use name:: again for accessing a;

or we can using namespace name;
then we dont need to use :: 

STORAGE CLASSES-
storage for global or namespace scope is allocated throughout the program and this is called static storage
also automatic storage is generated for local variables (within block code) only available during that block.

static storage variable that are not initialized are automatically initialized to zero.
whereas automatic storage variable(local) that are not initialized are left uninitialized 
and give random value(undetermined value)
