We can create new classes extending , i.e retaining the characteristics of the base class.
This process is inheritance,it involves base class and derived class

derived class inherits the members of base class and also can define its own members also.
derived classes can access the protected members of base class but not private members.

class derived_class:public base_class{
    ...
};
access specifier can be anything public,private,protected
This access specifier limits the most accessible level for the members inherited 
from the base class: The members with a more accessible level are inherited with 
this level instead, while the members with an equal or more restrictive access 
level keep their restrictive level in the derived class.


Since public is the most accessible level, by specifying this keyword the derived 
class will inherit all the members with the same levels they had in the base class.
With protected, all public members of the base class are inherited as protected in the derived class. 
Conversely, if the most restricting access level is specified (private), all the base class 
members are inherited as private.


Access	                    public	protected	private
members of the same class	yes	    yes     	yes
members of derived class	yes	    yes	        no
not members	                yes	    no      	no



a publicly derived class inherits every member of base class except:
constructor destructor
assignment operator members
friends
private members

MULTIPLE INHERITANCE-
To inherit data members from multiple classes , mention in base_class 
separated by comma with each access specifier for it.


POLYMORPHISM - 
One of the key features of class inheritance is that a pointer to a derived class is 
type-compatible with a pointer to its base class.
Polymorphism is the art of taking advantage of this simple but powerful and versatile feature.

A virtual member is a member function that can be redefined in a derived 
class, while preserving its calling properties through references.
