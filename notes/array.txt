An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations 
that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

type name [length];  --length must be constant expression

initialize arrays using ({})curly braces

int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
can initialize empty also or with less elements than the size specified

when initializing we can leave [] empty ,it will automatically get the array size

#include<array>
this has some in built functions, only declaration is different
array <type,size> array_name {};
